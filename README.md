Big Data Retriever

There are plenty of interesting resources provided by Wikidata via its SPARQL endpoint. 
Develop a (micro-)service-based platform able to "intelligently" query, compare, visualize, share, summarize, etc. large (sets of) data/knowledge and additional resources. 
Also, this Web system will recommend related information and/or similar resources available in other languages. 
Various computations could be performed by using existing big data techniques and tools –explore Awesome Big Data and Awesome Data Engineering.
